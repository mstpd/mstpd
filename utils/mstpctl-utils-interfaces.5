.TH MSTPCTL-UTILS-INTERFACES 5 "April 29 2013" "mstpctl-utils" "File formats"
.SH NAME
mstpctl-utils-interfaces \- mstpctl-utils extensions for the
.BR interfaces (5)
file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
/etc/network/interfaces contains network interface configuration
information for the
.BR ifup (8)
and
.BR ifdown (8)
commands.
This manpage describes the mstpctl extensions to the standard
.BR interfaces (5)
file format.
.P
The main extension is the mstpctl_ports option, with it you describe that the
interface is a bridge and what ports does it have. Spanning Tree protocol
parameters can also be specified.
Currently multiple spanning trees are not supported by this extension (although mstpd/mstpctl supports MSTP without restrictions). This means that all settings here are applied to the CIST tree.
.P
We'll see this with an example:
.EX
auto br0
iface br0 inet static
    address 12.0.0.3
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    mstpctl_ports swp1 swp2 swp3 swp4
    mstpctl_stp on
    mstpctl_maxwait auto
    mstpctl_maxage 20
    mstpctl_fdelay 15
    mstpctl_maxhops 20
    mstpctl_txholdcount 6
    mstpctl_forcevers rstp
    mstpctl_portpathcost swp1=0 swp2=0
    mstpctl_portadminedge swp1=no swp2=no swp4=yes
    mstpctl_portautoedge swp1=yes swp2=yes
    mstpctl_portp2p swp1=no swp2=no
    mstpctl_portrestrrole swp1=no swp2=no

.EE
.SH IFACE OPTIONS
The below interface options for configuring STP parameters on an STP
enabled bridge can be specified in /etc/network/interfaces.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_ports " interface specification"
this option must exist to specify the bridge and the ports which need
to be added to the bridge.
.RS
.EX
mstpctl_ports swp1 swp4
.EE
.P
Regular expressions can be used to select a number of interfaces
.EX
mstpctl_ports regex (eth|vif).*
.EE
This means to evaluate (as in
.BR egrep (1))
the expressions that
follow after "regex" until either the end or a "noregex" statement
is reached.
.SS
.TP
.BI mstpctl_stp " yes|no"
turn spanning tree protocol on/off, default is no.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_maxwait " time|auto"
set max time in seconds to wait for initial STP convergence before
allowing ifup to exit, default is auto (=\fIfdelay\fP*2+1).
.TP
.BI mstpctl_maxage " time"
set max message age to \fItime\fP seconds, default is 20.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_fdelay " time"
set bridge forward delay to \fItime\fP seconds, default is 15.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_maxhops " max_hops"
set bridge maximum hops to \fImax_hops\fP, default is 20.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_forcevers " mstp|rstp|stp"
forces the bridge to use specific STP protocol version. mstp is the default.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_txholdcount " tx_hold_count"
set bridge transmit hold count to \fItx_hold_count\fP, default is 6.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_treeprio " priority"
set bridge tree priority, \fIpriority\fP is between 0 and 15. Bridge priority affects bridge id, lowest priority bridge will be the root. Note that traditionally bridge priority is a multiple of 4096 and ranges from 0 to 15*4096 = 61440. mstpd is different - it throws out that useless "multiple of 4096" rule and expresses bridge priority in natural units (0-15). Default is 8.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portpathcost " port cost"
set path cost for a port, default is 0 (= auto), \fIport\fP is the name of
the interface to which this setting applies.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portadminedge " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the admin edge state of the \fIport\fP, default is no.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portautoedge " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the auto transition to/from edge state of the \fIport\fP,
default is yes.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portp2p " port yes|no|auto"
Enables/disables the point2point detection mode of the \fIport\fP,
default is auto.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portrestrrole " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the restrictions on the \fIport\fP's ability to take root role,
default is no (i.e. no restrictions on the port's role).
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portrestrtcn " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the restrictions on the \fIport\fP's ability to propagate received topology change notification, default is no (i.e. no restrictions on the TCN propagation).
.TP
.BI mstpctl_bpduguard " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the bpduguard configuration of the \fIport\fP, default is no.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_treeportprio " port priority"
sets the \fIport\fP's priority to \fIpriority\fP. The priority value is a number between 0 and 15. Note that traditionally port priority is a multiple of 16 and ranges from 0 to 15*16 = 240. mstpd is different - it throws out that useless "multiple of 16" rule and expresses port priority in natural units (0-15). Default is 8.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_hello " time"
set hello time to \fItime\fP seconds, default is 2.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_ageing " time"
sets the ethernet (MAC) address ageing \fItime\fP, in seconds. Used only when protocol version is forced to STP, default is 300s. Note that this parameter differs from the other ones: it is only informational parameter. By setting it in the mstpd one do not change the real bridge's Ageing Time; it is supposed to be set as information to the mstpd that real Ageing Time in the real bridge was changed.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portnetwork " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the bridge assurance capability for a \fIport\fP,
default is no.
.TP
.BI mstpctl_portbpdufilter " port yes|no"
Enables/disables the bridge BPDU filter capability for a \fIport\fP,
default is no.
